# N_EnhancedAutosave
Adds some improvements to the existing autosave feature, namely:

- The ability to stop autosaves from increasing the "Save Count" variable.
- The ability to disable autosaves for individual maps (for example Test maps).
- A window that displays whether an autosave is in progress, has succeeded, or has failed.
- A Plugin Command to trigger autosaves at any time during an event. Useful after a lengthy cutscene, a completed quest, or even shortly before an important decision.
